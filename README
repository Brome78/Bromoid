Hi its a little interface uses Flask, adb and scrcpy to manage some android devices.

You need to:

pip install Flask

Download and install scrcpy

python3 main.py

go to http://localhost:5000/

Troobleshoot:

If console return :

Address already in use
Port 5000 is in use by another program. Either identify and stop that program, or start the server with a different port.

do :

killall adb
